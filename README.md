# Cyclic Scheduling Algorithm and Aperiodic Scheduling Algorithm has been implemented using python code


# Rate Monotonic Scheduling
Rate Monotonic Schedule of the Periodic Tasks has been implement using the python code. The same code with some modification can be utilized to make code of a Deadline Monotonic Scheduling Algorithm.


# Poller-and-Deferrable-Server
Generating Periodic and Aperiodic Tasks then giving them to the Poller and Deferrable Server
